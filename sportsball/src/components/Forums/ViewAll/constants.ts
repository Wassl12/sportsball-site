export const angryBuckeye = `OK, listen up, morons! This is an emergency, a code red, a full-blown disaster! Ohio State's defense is an absolute dumpster fire, and that dumbass coordinator needs to be launched into the sun! I mean, seriously, what the heck are they doing out there?! I'm telling you, it's like watching a bunch of blind squirrels trying to play chess. Our defense couldn't stop a toddler on a tricycle, let alone a real football team! They're softer than mashed potatoes and slower than a snail on tranquilizers. Our coordinator? Ha! More like the Clowninator! I bet he spends his days eating glue and drawing stick figures instead of developing game plans. It's like he's allergic to the word "adjustment." I'm pretty sure he couldn't find his way out of a paper bag if his life depended on it.And don't even get me started on the secondary. They couldn't cover a bed with a blanket! It's like they're competing in a contest to see who can give up the most yards. I wouldn't trust them to guard a paperclip. They're a disgrace to the term "defense."We need a real defensive coordinator, someone with half a brain and a pulse! It's time to clean house, kick that idiot to the curb, and bring in someone who can actually make our defense great again. We deserve better, damn it!So, Buckeyes, let's unite in our anger and demand change! Let's make some noise, throw some tomatoes if we have to, until they finally listen. It's time to fix this mess and restore the honor of Ohio State football!Fire the damn coordinator, or I swear I'll... I'll... well, I don't know what I'll do, but it won't be pretty! Fix it, Ohio State, or face the wrath of a fan driven to madness!`

Your play calling was so predictable, I could have called the plays from my couch, while chomping on potato chips! Pathetic! I'm so furious right now, I can't even see straight. I feel like ripping my Alabama gear to shreds! I'm done, I'm freaking done! I'm going to drown my sorrows in an ocean of booze. I don't even care anymore. This loss has crushed my spirit. Alabama, get your act together! I demand answers, I demand change! This ain't the Alabama football I know and love. I'm sick of this crap! Step it up, or I'm outta here! I'm off to find the nearest bar. I'll be drowning my anger and disappointment until I can't feel a damn thing. Thanks for nothing, Crimson Tide. Thanks for nothing.`
